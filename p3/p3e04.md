4.¿Para qué sirve retry? ¿Cómo evitarías caer en un loop infinito al usarla?
### Retry
Not all errors are fatal. Some just indicate that you need to try again. Retry is built in to Ruby's exception rescuing system. It's quite simple. If you use "retry" in your rescue block it causes the section of code that was rescued to be run again. Let's look at an example.
```ruby
begin
  retries ||= 0
  puts "try ##{ retries }"
  raise "the roof"
rescue
  retry if (retries += 1) < 3
end

# ... outputs the following:
# try #0
# try #1
# try #2

```
There are a few things to note here:

    * When retry is called, all of the code in between begin and rescue is run again. It most definitely does not "pick up where it left off" or anything like that.

    * If you don't provide some mechanism to limit retries, you will wind up with an infinite loop. (por eso tenes q usar guardas como en el ejemplo !!!)

    * Code in both the begin and rescue blocks are able to access the same retries variable in the parent scope.
